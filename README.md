# GrowOPG
In this repository, You can find all the available documents that were needed to create GrowOPG, a WebApp made by a team of students as our project for our Software Design class

<h2>What is GrowOPG?</h2>
Our WebApp is made for local businesses that want to increase their presence online, track their product while displaying to the customers what the business has to offer for a certain season. Thanks to  this app, the owner of the business can receive orders and track the quantity of products in stock - all in one place. As a buyer logs into our app he is given a choice of multiple products along with some informations about the product itself such as the methods of preparation of a product, its properties, the amount of resources left and all the other details a customer would be interested in. If the product is not available, the buyer will be prompted with the time of the next batch(when's the next harvest, when does the  production end or how much does it take to dry). As mentioned earlier, depending on the season, the products in offer may vary.
