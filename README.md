<h1>GrowOPG</h1>
<p>In this repository, You can find all the available documents that were needed to create GrowOPG, a WebApp made by a team of four students (David Kostić, David Maglica, Gabriel Mikulaco and Marin Maurovic) as our project for our Software Engineering class</p>

<p><strong>Fakultet:</strong> Fakulet Informatike u Puli (<strong>https://fipu.unipu.hr/</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Kolegij:</strong> Programsko Inženjerstvo (<strong>https://ntankovic.unipu.hr/pi</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Mentori:</strong> doc. dr. sc. Nikola Tanković (<strong>https://ntankovic.unipu.hr</strong>) i Toni Starčić, univ. bacc. inf.</p>

<h2>What is GrowOPG?</h2>
<p>Our WebApp is made for local businesses that want to increase their online presence, track their product while displaying to the customers what the business has to offer for a certain season. By using this app, the owner of the business can receive orders and track the quantity of products in stock - all in one place. Once a buyer (customer) logs into our app he is given a choice of multiple products along with some informations about the product itself, such as the methods of preparation of a product, its properties, the amount  left and other details a customer could be interested in. If the product is not available, the buyer will be shown the time of arrival of the next batch (when's the next harvest, when does the production end or how much does it take to dry). As mentioned earlier, depending on the season, the products in offer may vary.</p>
